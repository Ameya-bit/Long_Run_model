# Long_Run_model

### Keynes - "In the long run, We are all dead"
- a criticism of people who believe that the economy will fix itself after an economic problem (focus on recessions for this model)
- the long run is not a set amount of time, but when all the economic variables change
- in the short run, some economic variables are considered fixed

### 2 models
- an economy will fix itself without any external help (stimulus, unemployment insurance)
- an economy needs external help (stimulus, unemployment insurance) to fix itself

### Goal
- I want to compare the two models, identify which one might be better and during what conditions

### Procedure
- recession is characterized by GDP, investment, consumer spending, and employment
- use a dataset of years specifying economic variables(gdp, unemployment percentage, etc)
- analyze years when recessions took place and the years that follow
    - did the economic variables change for the better in the short run?
    - did the economic variables change for the better in the long run?
